Check out [our Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/messmerd/GCC_LCA/wiki) for instructions on how to use the LCA Sync application and information on the source code for LCA Sync and all our Arduino prototypes. 

## LCA Sync Installation Guide 

An installer is included in the GCC LCA repository to make installation of the LCA Sync Application very easy. And these instructions will walk you through that installation process to make it even easier.

Prerequisites:

* Windows 10 or 8.1
* A few MB of disk space (nothing to worry about!) 
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.1

LCA Sync Installation:

1. Download a .zip file of the GCC LCA repository if you haven't already. [Here is a direct download link.](https://github.com/messmerd/GCC_LCA/archive/master.zip)
2. Extract the .zip file
3. Navigate to _GCC_LCA/LCA_SYNC/LCA_SYNC_Installer/Release/_
4. Run _setup.exe_
5. Follow instructions given by the installer. It may require you to download and install a particular version of Microsoft's .NET Framework before you can precede with the installation.
6. And that's it! Note: The installer doesn't create a desktop shortcut, so you will have to create one yourself if you want one.
